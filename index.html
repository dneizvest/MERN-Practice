      <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
      <ul id="past-shows">
        <li>Kevin is 5'4'' and proud! The Celebrity Game Face host is definitely not afraid to poke fun at himself, and in 2011, he even went as far as making his own iPhone app to do so.

            "Little Jumpman" was described as a "vertically challenged game of skill [that] will make you laugh and cry with Kevin as he reaches for the sky."
            
            Talk about a good sport!</li>
        <li>Kevin is deathly afraid of insects—even harmless bugs like butterflies and grasshoppers are off limits for the comedian—and filming Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle in Hawaii forced him to constantly face his fears as there were bugs everywhere.

            His co-star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson certainly didn't help alleviate his anxiety, and one time, he even threw a fake poisonous spider at Kevin!
            
            "It was a good day," The Rock joked.</li>
        <li>Kevin wanted to be an NBA player growing up, and while pursuing his dream, he wound up attending the same basketball camp as Kobe Bryant. 

            Though he didn't exactly make the impression that the Lakers legend did—at one point, Kobe used only his left hand to dominate the entire camp—Kevin technically did go on to play in the NBA by making a number of appearances at the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game.
            
            Kevin even took home the MVP award four straight years in a row!</li>
        <li>Kevin was once told to quit comedy by the man that helped discover Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy and Jerry Seinfeld!

            Early in his career, Kevin performed for talent booker and manager Lucian Hold, and it definitely didn't go as Kevin had hoped it would. 
            
            "I go do my audition. I'm killing it. The crowd's going crazy," Kevan recalled. "I get done, Lucian takes me in the back. He said, 'Do you do anything else?' Like, do I have another occupation. And he looked me in the eyes and said, 'Well you should think about doing something else because this isn't for you."
            
            Oh how wrong he was!</li>
